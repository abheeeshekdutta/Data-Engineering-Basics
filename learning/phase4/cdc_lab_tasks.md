# Phase 4 Lab Tasks (Ingestion + CDC)

1. Execute batch ingestion from CSV sources.
2. Add one API source and land results into `raw` schema.
3. Validate incremental watermark behavior in `state.json`.
4. Register Debezium connector for `raw.orders`.
5. Produce source updates and validate CDC events.
6. Add nullable column in source and validate consumer compatibility.
7. Document batch vs CDC tradeoffs with concrete examples.
